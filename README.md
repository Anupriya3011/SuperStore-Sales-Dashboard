# SuperStore-Sales-Dashboard
Dashboard Creation: We make a dashboard (a page with visuals) that looks good and is easy to use. It shows important numbers (KPIs) and lets users interact with data by using filters and clicking on charts to get more details.
Data Analysis: We look closely at the data to find helpful information. This helps the business see how well their sales strategies are working by showing results in easy-to-understand visuals, like charts.
Sales Forecasting: We use past sales data to predict what sales might look like for the next 15 days, using methods that spot patterns over time.
Actionable Insights and Recommendations: We give clear suggestions and ideas based on the data, which can help the business make smart decisions to improve growth, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
